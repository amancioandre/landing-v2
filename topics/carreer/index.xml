Today it is also used to build modern narratives, with Luke Skywalker, William Wallace, Frodo Baggins and almost any hero you can think of. Although strongly debated within Psychological Schools, the concept is still very present and influential on our society, so much so that we can feel them deeply embedded into us.</description></item></channel></rss>
