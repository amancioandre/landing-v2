"Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome. If I win I will be happy, if I don't I won't. It is a if then, a cause and effect […] standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it every time we attain it. You see, happiness demands a certain outcome, it is result reliant. If happiness is what you are after then you are going to be let down frequently and you are going to be unhappy most of your time. Joy though, joy is a different thing, it is something else. Joy is not a choice, it is not a response to some result. It is a constant. Joy is the feeling that we have from doing what we are fashioned to do… no matter the outcome." - Matthew McConaughey
