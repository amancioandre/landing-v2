"Quéops, Quéfren e Miquerinos." (in Brazilian Portuguese).

My grandfather was my first teacher. He would often tell us stories about ancient Egypt, always naming the three Gize great pyramids - "Cheops, Khfren, Menkaure" - he was a teacher by trade. He taught kids on the rural outskirts of a small Brazilian town called São José do Rio Pardo, in the state of São Paulo. Mr. Rubens Amâncio, or Vô Rubinho, was a dear sweet man, those of the old traditions, humble, father of three girls. He were a tick moustache and had a comb on his short sleeved berge shirt front pocked. Well cared shoes, ironed pants and a glasses's pouch attached to his belt. Tall, slim, born in 1917, blessed everyone at his door, and this memories happend in the first third of my life. Unfortunately I've never went to one of his classes, this is not a story of skills of any sort. **This is a story of love**.

Sometimes he would take us to school in his old Wolkswagen, all across town. It was a rough road, since with was paved with cobble stones, but the ride was really fun. The region was his from craddle, he knew everyone and everything. Our town was also the final rest place of one of the greatest Brazilian authors, [Mr. Euclides da Cunha](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Euclides-da-Cunha), and his deeds found voice in my grand dad stories. His books and the importance of stories - and how tragically people can steer their lives to. We would often learn about the coffee that was produced on our region, how the coffee tree becomes when is loaded with red swollen beans ready for harvest.

He was also a bird creator, and his birds were magnificent singing, so he would tell us stories of award winning species and often whistle his prized bird songs - or how to tend each variety, what they need to eat, how many times, how to tend to new eggs or those breaking shell. Those weak, would gain some help from his caring hands with some pliers - others not so luck, would have the uttermost respect and a restfull place dug by hand. Coleirinhos, trinca-ferros, tico-ticos, curiós, canárinhos-da-terra.

To be a teacher is to be destined to remember, and to be taught is to be humble - be open to learn all your lessons again.
