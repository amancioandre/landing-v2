If you are a user of conda packages, more precisely Jupyter Notebook, as I am, you should wory - a lot! - with your programming environment and your OS. Your environment is one of the barriers that prevent you from cloging your system with all sorts of packages and their - conflicting - versions.

Today it is also used to build modern narratives, with Luke Skywalker, William Wallace, Frodo Baggins and almost any hero you can think of. Although strongly debated within Psychological Schools, the concept is still very present and influential on our society, so much so that we can feel them deeply embedded into us.</description></item></channel></rss>
